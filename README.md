ROUTE IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC

--- Create an Endpoint that takes a string as input through path param and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
--- 1. it's guarded and expects ACCESS-KEY in the header and validates it

For example: given the input "abcabcbb", the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", so the function should return 3. Another example is "bbbbb", where the longest substring is "b", and the function should return 1.
